List positive and negative test cases for each of the following sets of requirements
(You do not need to write the tests):

Should divide two integers
Answer: The result have be a positive Integer of the division of each one

Positive test case: Divide two positive integers (e.g., 10 / 2 = 5)
Negative test case: Divide by zero (e.g., 10 / 0 → error or exception)

Should calculate the area of a square from an integer width
Answer: The result have be the product of each integer width

Positive test case: Calculate area with positive width (e.g., width = 4 → area = 16)
Negative test case: Calculate area with negative width (e.g., width = -3 → invalid input)

Should sum an array of integers
Answer: The result have be the sum of each element of the list

Positive test case: Sum an array with positive integers (e.g., [2,2)
Positive test case: Sum an array with negative and positive integers (e.g., [5, -2, 3] → 6)
Positive test case: Sum an empty array (e.g., [] → 0)

Negative test case: Sum an array with non-integer elements (e.g., [1, "a", 3] → error)
Negative test case: Sum a null array (e.g., null → error)

Should identify the number that occurs the most frequently in an array
Answer: The result have the element that is repeat in the list

Positive test case: Array with a clear most frequent number (e.g., [1,)
Positive test case: Array with all elements the same (e.g., [7, 7,
Positive test case: Array with two numbers tied for most frequent (e.g., [1, or 2, depending on implementation)
Positive test case: Array with only one element (e.g., → 5)

Negative test case: Array is empty (e.g., [] → no result or error)
Negative test case: Array contains non-integer elements (e.g., [2, "b", 2] → error)
Negative test case: Array is null (e.g., null → error)
